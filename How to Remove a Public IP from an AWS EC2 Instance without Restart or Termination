Be sure to follow these steps in this exact order!

1. Go to your running EC2 instance with the public IP you want to remove. Note what region and availability zone are associated with that instance.

In this example, we are using an instance in the Canadian central region in the 1b availability zone
2. On the left-hand panel, scroll and go into “Network Interfaces” under the “Network and Security” Dropdown. Once there, click “Create Network Interface.” In the description, give it a memorable name (we used “TEST 1b” in this example). For the subnet, pick a matching one for the instance from Step 1. Click “Create” to finish.


ca-central-1b in this example
3. Next, go it elastic IPs (also under the “Network and Security” Dropdown). After you create a new elastic IP, associate it with the EC2 instance.


4. Next, go back to your running EC2. Right-click it and select “Attach Network Interface” under the “Networking” option


5. From here, attach the network interface made previously.


6. Next, disassociate the elastic IP from the instance. If done properly, the public IP should disappear.

7. Finally, detach the network interface, this will remove the second private IP that was added.

8. Make sure to disassociate the elastic IP first before detaching the extra network interface!
